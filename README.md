# Devolo-dlan-linux
Configuration tool for devolo dLAN products

This software is based on software I found 'software-dlan-linux-6.1.tar.gz'. It is used to configure (by command line) Devolo dLAN power bricks. I have found that it also works with some other equipment.
Since the software does not compile anymore with recent gcc versions, I keep updates to the original software in this repository.
